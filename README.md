# Solo Python Project - Shop Inventory

### A inventory system to track individual products and manufacturers. This was a solo project built over 7 days during my 11th week of the Part-Time Software Development Course at CodeClan.

### MVP
* The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
* The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
* The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately.
* Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
* As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
### My Extensions
* A markup percentage calculator
* Two product filters
* A bargraph responsive to changing data
